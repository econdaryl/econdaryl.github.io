####Who am I?
I am a Pre-PhD Economics student and research assistant. I graduated from BYU in April 2017 with a BS in Economics and a minor in Mathematics. I currently work in the Real Estate Finance Section at the Federal Reserve Board, assisting with research and policy work in Urban Economics and related topics.

At BYU, I worked for Drs. Joseph Price and Kerk Phillips at BYU. I worked with Dr. Price from 2016-2018, gathering, cleaning, and analyzing data for projects in Applied Microeconomics using Stata and Python. I joined Dr. Phillip's research in June 2017-June 2018, and assisted with research in Computational Macroeconomics using Python, specifically working on implementing Generalized Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (GSSA) solution techniques in Python.
